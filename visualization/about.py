        ### About Me
        I am a recent graduate from an engineering school in France, specializing in Computer Science.  
        I have always been particularly curious about the more mathematical aspects of computer science, which led me to study machine learning extensively and work as a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist during my internship.  
        Driven by my passion for highly competitive environments, I am eager to enter the world of quantitative finance, where I can combine my love for mathematics and programming.  

        Over the past few months, I have dedicated my time to learning about financial engineering and quantitative analysis, which I hope to leverage in my future career.  
        With a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, I am confident in my ability to learn quickly and adapt to the challenges of financial institutions.
